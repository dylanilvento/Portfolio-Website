					Ori and the Blind Forest is the debut game of independent developer Moon Studios, a studio comprised mainly of former AAA developers working on the game in remote locations, including Austria, Australia, the United States, and Israel. Developed using the Unity game engine, Ori was created over the span of four years and was published by Microsoft for the Xbox One and Windows platforms on March 11, 2015.

					<p>It almost goes without saying, but <em>Ori</em> is a very beautiful game. All of the characters and environments exhume vibrant colors that shimmer and shine. Even the main villain, Kuro, a giant made of shadow and darkness, has a ton of indigo and violet in her plumage. The design of the characters and world is reminiscent of animated films like Ferngully or Don Bluth productions like Secret of NIMH or Thumbelina, where exotic foliage fills the screen. The level of detail has been commented upon by Moon Studios’ CEO Thomas Mahler, who says that no two pieces of plant life in the game are reused, which probably contributed to Ori’s long production time.</p>

					<p>The characters themselves have very fluid animations, evoking the styles of games using Ubisoft’s UbiArt engine such as Rayman Legends and Valiant Hearts: The Great War. However, unlike UbiArt games, the characters are actually three dimensional models. The models’ animations are prerendered and compressed to sprite sheets, a technique first popularly utilized by Rare for the Donkey Kong Country series on the Super Nintendo.</p>

					<p>While the art style is stunning to observe, at times it can be distracting. Because everything in the world shares the same vibrancy, enemies and environmental hazards have a tendency to blend in with the background. More than once I overlooked a dangerous bramble bush while I tried to avoid an enemy’s projectiles, only to fall into the snare and die. Even the reticle of Ori’s primary attack, Spirit Flame – a ranged missile barrage that puts a fuzzy red glow around the nearest enemy (or enemies if you upgrade it) within range, can get lost within the red and violet hues of some of the enemies, making me unsure of whether or not I was in firing range.</p>

					<p>The overall story of Ori is heavy on tone but thin on plot. The story itself is narrated by the Spirit Tree, the benevolent guardian of the forest of Nibel – the setting of Ori – and the one who keeps the elements in balance within the forest. The Spirit Tree begins the story with the birth of the titular Ori, who is born from a leaf that fell from the Spirit Tree.</p>

					<p>Ori is discovered by Naru, a native of the forest, who adopts Ori, and they build a home together. Over time, food becomes scarce as the forest is dying, and Naru ends up starving to death so that Ori can eat. It’s a touching scene where the player understands the connection between the two characters, emphasized by the fact that the cinematic elements blend naturally with the minor gameplay portions and that the camera never leaves the 2D perspective used during the main game. However, I would say that the game suffers from Up syndrome: where the most emotionally engaging scene happens in the first ten minutes, and the rest of the story struggles to match it.</p>

					<p>After Naru passes, Ori ventures back out into the world, where he is called upon by the Spirit Tree and Sein – a spirit of the forest who aids him – to restore the forest to balance. He has to do so by restoring the three Elements of Light to their locations within the forest of Nibel. All the time, they are pursued by Koru, a giant owl of darkness, as well as other enemies.</p>

					<p>Now, most of those names I had to look up, since I couldn’t keep track of who was who. Names come at you, but they’re never distinguishable from one another. The word I would use to describe the greater portion of <em>Ori</em>’s story and setting is generic. There are villains. There are heroes. There are mystical fairies. There are MacGuffins of some kind. There’s an undertone of environmentalism and an overtone of twee. It’s the same kind of tentpoles people would find in films like <em>Ferngully</em>, <em>Secret of NIMH</em>, <em>Thumbelina</em>, and <em>The Spiderwick Chronicles</em> and in games like <em>Dust: An Elysian Tail</em>.</p>

					<p>There's a blurb on Moon Studios’ site about how Ori is a coming-of-age story, but outside the loss of a maternal figure, Ori doesn't evolve beyond being an avatar with which the player can shoot, swim, jump, and run. In fact, I would argue the enemies, Kuro as well as others, have more character development over the course of my time with the game than Ori does.</p>

					<p>I have heard that the story does pick up later on, but in the almost five hours that I’ve played of Ori, the most narratively engaging part was the introductory scene with Naru.</p>

					<p>In terms of genre, Ori can be primarily classified as a Metroidvania, a term used to describe games that evoke the layout of the Metroid and Castlevania series, where you traverse a giant map and can only circumvent specific obstacles after unlocking the requisite ability. Abilities are only unlocked after reaching a specific point in the story, so skill progression and the story are intimately connected in Metroidvania games. Some obstacles are only passable after finding certain items on the map, such as the spirit gates that require 2, 4, or even more Keystones to unlock.</p>

					<p>Ori also incorporates elements from other genres. It has challenging platforming sections akin to something like Super Meat Boy, where you have to time your jumps well lest you risk dying and restarting that section. Ori also has some light role-playing (RPG) elements. You have a life gauge – which is represented by discrete orbs of life (with which you have three to start) as opposed to as a continuous bar – as well as a spirit gauge for using some of your abilities. You also earn experience, which comes in the form of ability orbs that are found in the environment and dropped by enemies when they are defeated. When Ori collects enough ability orbs, he unlocks an ability point to use in an upgrade tree. The upgrades that you can unlock can improve the efficacy of your active abilities, such as increased damage or shooting at multiple targets at once, or equip you with passive abilities, such as magnetizing stray ability orbs to come to you.</p>

					<p>The abilities that consume Ori’s spirit gauge include a charged blast for destroying walls and enemies as well as summoning a save point that can also be used to access the upgrade tree. Since finding spirit gems to replenish your spirit gauge are somewhat scarce, there’s a great risk/reward consideration between depleting your spirit gauge in order to save versus foregoing the save in order to conserve spirit energy. The place where this breaks down is when you haven’t saved for a while, you’ve collected several keystones or even an ability point or two, and then you’re hit with a stray enemy projectile, forcing you to do all that over again. It’s one thing to die and have to redo platforming and combat challenges, since that’s the core gameplay, so it should be fun. However, it’s another thing to have to retread the exact path so that I regain all the collectables since the last time I died. It would be better to have collectables be saved to your person when you pick them up, so even when you have to repeat a section, all of your collected items are still with you.</p>

<p>In terms of dying, it will happen – a lot. In the first five hours of gameplay, I died upwards of seventy times (I know because there’s a handy death count as well as other stats on the pause screen). A far portion of these deaths are due to me failing platforming or combat challenges, but some of them are also due to the fact that you going into a fight ignorant of its difficulty. Enemies usually do 1 orb of damage to you when you’re hit, but some 2 orbs of damage. Why did that enemy do 2 orbs? Who knows! There’s nothing to demarcate enemies that do more damage. No color correspondence. No size difference. Nothing.</p>

<p>They say the signs of a good, challenging platformer are quick respawns and the feeling that the player never feels cheated when they die. Ori has lightning fast respawns that take you to your last save point the second you die. In fact, there are no loading points in the entire game, an impressive feat given its size and fidelity. However, I constantly felt cheated when I died. This is sometimes due to the combat. Since your only attack at the beginning is Ori’s Spirit Flame, which feels at times nothing more than a glorified reason to mash the X button, you can simply be outmaneuvered by enemies that have a longer range than you.</p>

<p>Some of frustration also comes from the early platforming. Ori’s controls can feel so swimmy at the beginning – partially due to none of the abilities having been unlocked yet, that escaping the fray for a moment to regain your bearings is impossible – it’s not until you unlock the Double Jump and Bash abilities do you feel like you have more control of the combat loop. In fact, after I unlocked Bash, an ability that allows you to pause time when you’re close to an enemy, projectile, or environmental prop and shoot yourself and the object in opposite directions, I found the game a lot more fun. If the later abilities are as enjoyable as Bash, I could see myself enjoying the back half of the game more than the front half.</p>

<p>However, this is hard to justify to someone who picks up the game and finds the first few hours slow going. Players shouldn’t have to slog through some portion of a game before the game starts being enjoyable. Another Metroidvania game, Guacamelee, takes a better tact with this. Even though you are weaker and without abilities at the beginning of the game, players in Guacamelee can still chain attacks together and have much more control over combat than in Ori, making combat more about player skill than about unlocking abilities.</p>

					<p>After the introductory scene with Naru, I got increasingly frustrated with Ori. The game felt impeded by the Metroidvania form, and it wasn’t fun to play. However, once I started to unlock more abilities, I started to have more fun, which I guess proves the Metroidvania thesis, but I feel like it also proves my argument against it. If the ramp from being frustrated to unlocking fun abilities was shorter, I think it would have been a more enjoyable experience.</p>

<p>In terms of story, there’s not much to make you want to keep going. The narration of the Spirit Tree throughout is interesting, but there’s little to no characterization of Ori or Sein, the protagonists that have the most screen time. In fact, Sein just seems like a generic stand-in for Navi from Ocarina of Time. There are some good little character moments though. The scenes with Naru, obviously, but there are also scenes where you chase a bumbling monster who has stolen one of the Elements of Light that are charming and have a good payoff later on. Overall, I just would want to see more of what makes Ori fun and engaging and less of what makes it frustrating and generic.
