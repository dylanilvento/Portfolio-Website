Originally made for [Global Game Jam 2015's](https://globalgamejam.org/2015/games) theme of "What Do We Do Now?," _Knight Life_ is a day-in-the-life comedy game prototype about a knight who tries to figure out what to do after they’ve defeated the monster. We imagined what a hero does after they save the day and there’s nothing left for them to do. They probably go home, make a sandwich, vedge out in front of the TV, watch as the days pass by after bringing peace to the realm.

I came back to this prototype a couple months after the game jam, and I was able to implement about a day's worth of intractable events with the knight, learning how to combine game interactivity with comedic timing.

Collaborators on this prototype include Mason Brown.
