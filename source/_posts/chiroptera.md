Made for [Global Game Jam 2017's](https://globalgamejam.org/2017/games/chiroptera) theme of "Waves," _Chiroptera_ is a 2D exploration game where you fly around as a bat in procedurally-generated caves. Using echolocation to momentarily light the cave, you have to navigate your way to the exit, avoiding walls, ceilings, and spider webs. I collaborated with one other programmer and two artists on this project. While our other developer handled the movement and logic of the bat, I helped with the procedurally-generated levels, implementing an A* pathfinding algorithm to guarantee that the player could always reach the exit on any level.

Made in collaboration with Steven Butkus, Emily Wolver, and Uri Hamman.
