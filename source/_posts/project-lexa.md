_Project Lexa_ is my current game project — a planned puzzle and exploration game where you interact with the environment by translating a logographic language. Each logogram glyph represents a morpheme, which is a single unit of language. You combine these morphemes into a single word that can be translated to and read in plain English. For instance, one glyph might represent the bound morpheme “un-,” and another might represent the free morpheme “life.” Combining these two together gives you the word “death.” Players must use these translations to solve environmental puzzles and explore an alien planet.

I’m currently building the system to translate the glyphs, and I’ve also built a tool to draw and generate new glyphs for the language within Unity for easier implementation. You can follow my progress on this game on [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/DylanIlvento/status/1306045093170868229).
