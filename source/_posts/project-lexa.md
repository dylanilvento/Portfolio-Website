_Project Lexa_ is my current game project — a planned puzzle and exploration game where you explore an alien world by translating a mysterious language. Words are represented by glyphs that are found on terminals, in books, on signs, and everywhere else in the world. Over time, the player will be able to go from translating very basic binary states — on and off, up and down, etc. — to translating full sentences, thereby solving harder and harder puzzles.

I’m currently in the process of building a playable minimum viable product to test the core game loop, this includes developing the system to interact with and translate glyphs as well as implementing some basic character movement and environment design using Unity's [2D Game Kit](https://learn.unity.com/project/2d-game-kit).

You can follow my progress on this game on [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/DylanIlvento/status/1306045093170868229).
