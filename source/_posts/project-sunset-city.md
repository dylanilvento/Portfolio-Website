_Project Sunset City_ is a 2D platformer prototype I made to practice creating my own 2D character controller with movements like jump, sprint, wall slide, and swim. I arrived at the game's feel by reverse-engineering the movement of NES-era platformers like _Super Mario Bros._ For instance, when the player uses the jump button, releasing it early will make the player character not jump as high, but if the player keeps the jump button depressed for longer, the character will jump higher.

There are also additional mechanics implemented like a slide mechanic for when you try to move in the opposite direction while sprinting and an early version of the visuals for the dialog system. This is also my first project in learning how to implement Cinemachine, allowing for a smoother camera experience.
